# Set Up Instructions
Clone or fork the repository and import it into AWS Amplify. Leave all default parameters as default (including leaving build parameters as blank). AWS Amplify should load in the index.html and all other front-end file automatically. All back-end code does not need to be deployed as they are already provided via our API triggers.

Alternatively if set up fails, use [our Amplify domain](https://main.d1zfh5jl8g0um5.amplifyapp.com/).
